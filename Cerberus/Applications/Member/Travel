with 2 additional coats of high-heat and fire-proof spray paint mix it will make the case water-proof, moisture-proof, dust-proof, fire-proof. The case comes with a version of Gorilla Glass that can be additionally modified and
upgraded by an experienced glass worker. One can then apply a privacy-screen onto the reverse-side of the Gorilla Glass and then use non-reversible screws with water-proof screw gaskets to make the cell phone: water-proof, dust-proof,
fire-proof and moisture-proof. If using the cell phone with this specific modified metal case it should make it extremely difficult for anyone to get into the phone or steal / switch out the SIM card while traveling because
the culprits will not have the tools at hand to disassemble the cell phone case to remove the parts or hack the cell phone physically. The cell phone can then be submerged into ~200 feet of water and will remain functional.

High Quality Rust-Proof Fixed Blade Knives With Blood-Drain, Hand-Guard and Kevlar / Paracord 750 Lanyard Make For The Most Dangerous Knife In The World. Why ? Because once
the lanyard is securely fastened around the wrist the knife cannot be removed from the wrist or from the hand and when anyone attempts to take the knife away they are instantly cut by the knife when they try to take it because
they cannot take it away from the hand or the wrist. Knife fighting with a lanyard is the best way to go because it cannot be removed from the hand or from the wrist therefore the only thing the knife weilder
can do is keep up with stabbing or cutting motions until the target is dead. One can kill bears, wild animals, enemy targets or any of those with an automatic rifle or a hand gun close range. Demonstrations have proven that an enemy with a hand gun or an automatic rifle
cannot aim and shoot fast enough close range against someone with a lanyard fixed blade knife and the experienced knife weilder can stab an enemy or animal up to 200 times in ~60 seconds. Some demonstrations and real-world scenarios have proven that a fixed blade lanyard knife weilder
can stab an enemy target that has a hand gun or an automatic rifle up to 200 times in the neck, head, chest, arms, hands and stomach in ~60 seconds. Fixed Blade Knives do not bend or break and if the Fixed Blade Lanyard has a Hand-Guard you can be sure that your hand will never slip onto the blade while using the knife. If the Fixed Blade Lanyard has a Blood-Drain the knife is guaranteed to not get stuck in the body of the enemy or the animal. Usually
a thin or thick blade will get stuck in the body of the target because the body is a vacuum and foreign objects will get stuck in it if penetrated, especially a knife if it does not have a Blood-Drain. Handling wild animals close range with a Fixed Blade Lanyard Knife is not difficult once practiced and different parts of the animals body can be removed quickly afterwards. One can also cut away and strip away all of the meat and muscle off of the animal very quickly once the animal is dead. If the blade is thick enough one can be guaranteed to cut through hardened bone with ease. Contrary to popular belief: Fixed Blade Lanyard Knives are more dangerous than a kitchen knife or a meat cleaver.
