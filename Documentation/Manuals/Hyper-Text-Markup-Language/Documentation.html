Cerberus Content Management System, Officially Registered Unix-Name: CerberusCMS and Cerberus-Content-Management-System in year 2000 - 2001 on FreshMeat which became SourceForge and then SlashDot Media.<BR><BR>

<B>Origins</B>

<B>Project Pagan-Like Cultural Theme</B><BR>
Cerberus Content Management System // Cerberus Web Application Framework With Officially Registered Unix Name: 'CerberusCMS' in year ~2000 - 2001 on http://www.FreshMeat.org is not to be confused with any other Applications or Web Applications with the name Cerberus.
Cerberus Content Management System was custom written in Pre-Hyper-Text-Post-Processor Programming Code over a span of 2 summers in Oildale, California from around year ~2000 - 2001 and then it was officially registered on http://www.FreshMeat.org.<BR><BR>

The direct Web Application project fork is named Fenrir Content Management System. The word Fenrir is from Scandinavian Folklore and was supposedly the name of the Demi-God Wolf belonging to the Scandinavian God Loki.
Fenrir Content Management System features all Heathen-Like visible theming as well as Heathen-Like Programming and Heathen-Themed Programming Code ASCII Art because of the Scandinavian Northern-Frisian and Western-Frisian Heathen ancestry of its author.
The Official Cerberus Content Managemet System Software Project follows the standard adoption of Greek culture in Western-American Academia where Greek cultural ideas and symbols are used.<BR><BR>

The name Cerberus is from the Greek Three-Headed Hound of Hades who guarded the entrance to the after life in Greek Mythology. The idea was that in computer binary: 1 is: on and 0 is: off which can
also be likened to 1 is: alive or 0 is: dead.<BR><BR>

Each release of CerberusCMS after CerberusCMS - Version Number: 4, Build Number: 0.8, Edit Number: 399 comes with alternate editions named FenrirCMS and RuneCMS for installation where the entire system is themed around Heathen / Germanic Pagan Gods and Goddesses where in these alternate editions there is no mention of Cerberus and instead of Cerberus it is themed with the names of Heathen / Germanic Gods and Goddesses with Heathen themed graphics and ascii art.
Wodan / Odin, Freyja, Heimdallr and others.<BR><BR>

<B>CerberusCMS comes with several additional applications</B>:<BR>
* Architect, This is a Pre-Hyper-Text-Post-Processor Web Application that configures and installs CerberusCMS to the Web Server.<BR>
* Hephaestus, which is named after the Greek God of architecture. This is a Pre-Hyper-Text-Post-Processor Web Application that builds CerberusCMS from scratch by creating and making the organized directory structure and each of the Application files directly on the Web Server Data Storage Medium itself. This builds a clean and free-of-malware instance of CerberusCMS.<BR>
* Pre-Installation ToolKit, This is a Pre-Hyper-Text-Post-Processor Web Application that downloads and unpacks pre-made archive packages of CerberusCMS to a Web Server.<BR>
* Charon, which is named after the Ferryman to the afterlife in Greek Mythology. This is a Personal-Computer Compilable C++ Application that builds a clean installation of CerberusCMS to the local server data storage medium.<BR>
* Iris, which is named after the Goddess of Messages in Greek Mythology. This is a Google Android Open Source Software Project Application as well as an Apple iOS Swift Application that can be installed to an Android Mobile Phone and an Apple iPhone. It is used to connect to a web server that has CerberusCMS installed on it. It is much like the FaceBook Messenger and FaceBook Application.<BR>
* Asclepius, which is named after the Goddess of healing. This is a Pre-Hyper-Text-Post-Processor Web Application that performs extensive diagnostics on the installation of CerberusCMS and offers to reinstall any files with permission from the automated Services Administration Account.<BR><BR>

CerberusCMS was the author's first software project started when the author was 14 years old. The project originally was written to cater to a small V-TM:R video game community to host expansion packs and video game mods. Later in 2007 - 2009 it was used in the [[XBMC]] community before that project was forked to Kodi Media Center. Customized Application Modules were made to control the XBMC install from any web browser. This Web Application was originally used as a long distance communications platform from the Internet by small groups from ~2000 to 2006.<BR><BR>

<B>Loss of Development Progress</B><BR>
Around 2 years of development progress was lost before 2013. Several fake versions of this project were put on display so as to distract certain groups.
The official project is 100% Pure Pre-Hyper-Text-Post-Processor Programming Code.<BR><BR>

<B>Project Versioning Systems</B><BR><BR>

<B>Software Project Versioning System</B><BR>
The Cerberus Content Management System Project versioning system follows a logical pattern of versioning by ascending number and builds by ascending number with edit numbers.<BR><BR>

All builds are generated from a C++ application named Charon alternately named Freyja where this C++ application takes manually written Pre-Hyper-Text-Post-Processor programming code from the official CerberusCMS GIT repositories and then it generates the organized directory structure to the hard disk drive where it can be further hand typed and manually hand updated. This eliminates the possibilities of malware carryover in case any files are injected with malicious code during the project development process.<BR><BR>

Once an official build number reaches 100 where it has progressed to an acceptable level of development and features an entirely new version of the project is announced and released into public circulation.<BR><BR>

<B>Releases follow</B>:<BR>
CerberusCMS - Version Number: **Number**, Build Number: **Number** and Edit Number: **Number**<BR><BR>

Each official release in different packaged forms are accompanied with a Portable-Document-Format
documentation file and a SHA-512 HASH for comparison.<BR><BR>

<B>Application Module Versioning System</B><BR>
Each Application Module has a version number where newer and improved Application Modules ascend in number.<BR><BR>

<B>Kernel File Versioning System</B><BR>
The Kernel File versioning system follows a logical pattern of version numbers by ascending number. Newer and improved Kernel Files ascend in number.<BR><BR>

<B>Project Cycles</B><BR><BR>

<B>Project Development Cycles</B><BR>
The development team may spend several weeks or months brainstorming, custom writing programming code, implementing that new programming code into the official system and also evaluating the system
for places and things that can be improved. Situations are sometimes rehearsed and evaluated so as to write and implement expert programming code into the system.<BR><BR>

Adding new features to the system consists of exactly this.<BR><BR>

<B>Project Brainstorming and Rehearsals</B><BR>
Brainstorming and Rehearsals are normally done such as when rehearsals were done before to evaluate possibilities of session hijacking so as to secure this project from that. Examples of this would be like if anyone else were watching someone type in their username and password from a public area then that person could login to the account of the person they watched type in their username and password and from that specific location because it is done from the same Internet Protocol Address as the actual account on the system. Even if the session programming code restricts authentication to that specific Internet Protocol Address or other combined factors it is still possible even today.<BR><BR>

Nearly every social media services provider in the world is still vulnerable to account hijacking like this where even the entire session string can be dumped from the network that the user account is currently authenticated to and then by copying those strings into an entirely different computer to get into the account and remain logged-in to the account being hacked.<BR><BR>

Security rehearsals of every possible situation turn to evaluation of programming code so as to write secure programming code to prevent these things from being possible.<BR><BR>

<B>Project Programming Code Debugging</B><BR>
Once new features and programming code updates are added there is a debugging process where every part of the system is manually and thoroughly debugged and perfected by the development team.
Once the system is completely perfected and functional the development team then moves to document and hash the finished additions.<BR><BR>

<B>Quality Programming Code</B><BR>
All programming code is organized in Pre-Ordered Logical and Pre-Oredered Mathematical style. All of the programming code is documented with organized Documentation Panels within the source code that is readable by anyone with no programming knowledge. All of the programming maintains consistency in style and indentation. All of the project programming code is 100% Pure Pre-Hyper-Text-Post-Processor programming code.<BR><BR>

<B>Project Update Cycles</B><BR>
System Updates consist of Programming Code Updates, Programming Code Security Updates, Graphics Updates and more.
Officially released versions come with an embedded build number where the build itself takes several weeks or months of quality code implementation and updates from the project developer.
CerberusCMS - Version Number: 4, Build Number: 0.8 was hand updated by rewrite periodically from ~ January of 2022 to November of 2023.<BR><BR>

<B>Project Compatibility and Life Cycle</B><BR>
CerberusCMS - Version Number: 4, Build Number: 0.8 was hand updated by rewrite periodically from ~ January of 2022 to November of 2023. This specific Version Number and Build Number will work for 10 years on Pre-Hyper-Text-Post-Processor Version Number: 8.
Major programming code updates implemented heavy use of encryption and data sanitization. It was remade for heavy use of Structured-Query-Language queries and concurrent connections numbering in the 100s of thousands.
With a Server Setup on a rack with 3 different dedicated, separated and security hardened S.Q.L. Server, P.H.P. / Apache Server and Data Storage Server the system can support up to 20,000 unique active concurrent user-connections without any lag in response time.<BR><BR>

<B>End-User System Update Cycles</B><BR>
* The entire system can be updated from the Administration Control Panel where a Services Root Administrator can initiate the update.<BR>
* The update process uses different terminal commands from the Web Server itself to download the official updates to a temporary directory in the system and then replaces by logical transaction each Application Module to the new version.<BR>
* Kernel updates consist of the same process mentioned before.<BR>
* The entire system is modular where each Application Module as well as the Kernel File itself is hashed in the Secure Hash Algorithm, SHA-512 based on the exact file size of the component in bytes.<BR>
* The official file Hash Strings are checked against the official Master Server and Master GIT Repository hash strings where then the Master File allows or disallows the installation based on authentic file integrity if the Application Module undergoing installation is an official Application Module.<BR><BR>

Since this CMS is so modular the entire system will continue working if any connected part ever breaks. If any connected Application Module that is official ever breaks or if any byte changes in the programming code it is instantly reinstalled from
the official GIT repository upon one reload of any part of the system. This layer of security makes it just about impossible for this CMS to be hacked because it would instantly reinstall the component that changed in HASH integrity.<BR><BR>

<B>Project Release Cycles</B><BR><BR>

<B>Official Project Release Cycles</B><BR>
CerberusCMS comes with a Kernel File, Installation and Maintenance Applications, Organized Directory Structure, High Definition Graphics and around 89 to 100 official and unique Application Modules that are capable of performing daily tasks as well as management of content and data.<BR><BR>

<B>Internal Language Control Features</B><BR>
Internal language files allow for instant translation of the output messages to any language. Custom languages can also be made and installed such as Hackish, Binary, Elvish and more. Each output message is invoked throughout the system by variables with an organized prefix name. The entire Master Language File can be updated to display the messages in any language.<BR><BR>

The language can be changed at any time to any other language through the Language Application Module. Additional languages can be downloaded and installed from the Administration Control Panel.<BR><BR>

<B>Digital Trust Features</B><BR>
CerberusCMS is very unique because it allows for anyone to view the source code of all of the Documents, Application Modules and the Master File so named the 'Kernel' directly from the Web Application itself which is loaded into the web browser from the web server that is executing the CerberusCMS Programming Code and at the same time all of the transmitting data and stored information is secure from vulnerabilities and exploitation as well as being information secure because only certain details of information are actually displayed throughout the system.<BR><BR>

This establishes trust with the human interacting with it because that human can read through all of the Programming Source Code of the CerberusCMS instance running on that specific web server directly from the web browser to ensure that everything is private and secure and that there are no deliberate backdoors or exploit code programmed into the system. This makes it to where anyone can consult
an information security programming expert to look at the Web Server running CerberusCMS to guarantee the Programming Source Code is secure. Some automated vulnerability scanners will report a vulnerabiity called 'Source Code Disclosure', but this is not a vulnerability so long as the source code programming is secure. It's possible for any web server in the world to report fraudulent information even with integrity checks if the integrity checks are forged by the individual(s) in control of the Web Server. This is why the architecture designed is ingenious.<BR><BR>

All of the data that is stored in the Database Server is encrypted using G.N.U.-Privacy Guard, Pretty-Good-Privacy, BCRYPT, Advanced Encryption Standard - 256, Advanced Encryption Standard - 512 and other
algorithms, hashes and cipers deemed secure by the information security community.<BR><BR>

It also allows for custom encryption algorithms and ciphers and custom mathematics to be used system-wide so as to secure the storage and transimission of specified data.
This is made for corporate-level security, medium to small business security and academic security so as to securely store the data and information of its users.<BR><BR>

by GIT command from the Cerberus Root account which remains active at all times.
This makes it impossible to hack the CerberusCMS instance by different programming code injection attacks just incase sanitization fails.<BR><BR>

There is a stand-alone integrity Application that checks the CerberusCMS instance integrity of each file and then compares the SHA-512 hashes of each file to
the Master Server. If the SHA-512 HASHES are different it then provides options to reinstall the Kernel and Application Modules by GIT command.<BR><BR>

CerberusCMS as of Version Number: 4, Build Number: 0.8 features 40,000 lines of quality and thoroughly documented Pre-Hyper-Text-Post-Processor programming code.<BR><BR>

<B>Programming Code Documentation</B><BR>
All of the programming code is extremely documented and manageable with approximately 7,000 panels of programming code documentation. The documentation panels within the source code explain in detail what every line of programming code in the system does. All of the programming code documentation features searchable programming code keys such as:<BR>
* [ @ ], meaning header.<BR>
* [ + ], meaning ending logical statement with explanation.<BR>
and more.<BR><BR>

Adding features to this web application as a novice programmer is very simple and straightforward.<BR><BR>

The idea behind the CerberusCMS project is for it to remain 100% Pure Pre-Hyper-Text-Post-Processor programming code with digital information security in mind.<BR><BR>

<B>End-User / Unofficial Application Module Development</B><BR>
End-Users with limited programming knowledge can create their own Application Modules by just a few steps, being:<BR><BR>

* 1. By writing the custom Application Module in the style of the Programming Code Framework.<BR>
* 2. By adding the output message variables to the language file.<BR>
* 3. By adding the POST and GET variables to the Master Sanitization security module.<BR><BR>

Application Modules can be written to do just about any computing task that P.H.P. is capable of from the web browser.<BR><BR>

<B>Bundled Software and Packages</B><BR>
CerberusCMS as of Version Number: 4, Build Number: 0.8 comes with Charon alternately named Freyja which is a compilable C++ application that can be compiled with G.C.C. and other C++ compiling applications from a terminal.<BR><BR>

Charon alternately named Freyja was combined from other C++ programming code that generated the theme files necessary to have a custom graphical theme on CerberusCMS.<BR><BR>

CerberusCMS also comes with Iris alternately named Hel which is an Android Open Source Software Project application as well as a SWIFT application for Apple iOS.<BR><BR>

<B>Charon alternately named Freyja does numerous things such as:<BR>
* Generates the clean, malware free organized directory structure of CerberusCMS to the local hard drive and then manually copies and pastes the CerberusCMS Project programming source code from the official GIT Repository to each file. This eliminates any possibility of malware carryover from system to system in case any files are injected with malicious code at any point in time in the development cycle.<BR>
* Generates custom CerberusCMS themes.<BR><BR>

<B>Iris alternately named Hel does numerous things as well, such as</B>:<BR>
* Connects a mobile device that is flashed with Android Open Source Software Project or with Apple iOS to the specified CerberusCMS installation on the specified web server.<BR>
* Capable of sending and receiving encrypted messenger messages.<BR>
* Capable of browsing the CerberusCMS installation.<BR><BR>

[[Charon]] is named after the ferryman of Hades in Greek Mythology who carried the living and the dead back and forth from Hades to Earth. [[Iris]] is named after the Greek Goddess of Messages in Greek Mythology.
[[Hel]] or [[Helvegen]] is a gatekeeper of the afterlife in [[Heathen]] / Germanic-Pagan mythology who is very similar to Charon in Greek Mythology.<BR><BR>

This web application was developed and written in Southern California. This project was started in 2001 when I was about 14 or maybe 15 years old... My girlfriend at the time... a nice laptop was given to me. I started learning computer programming back then. The updates for this specific project is slow because I don't have the time to work on it every day.
